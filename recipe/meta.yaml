  summary: 'An HTTP proxy server to automatically authenticate through an NTLM proxy'
  description: |
    Px is a HTTP(s) proxy server that allows applications to authenticate through
    an NTLM or Windows Kerberos authenticated proxy server, typically used in
    corporate deployments, without having to deal with the actual handshake. It is
    primarily designed to run on Windows systems and authenticates on behalf of the
    application using the currently logged in Windows user account.
